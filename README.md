# Audumbla

This code is designed to simulate the formation of planetary systems from a disk of planetesimals and planetary embryos. 
It is still in development. 

The file Disks.py contains the objects and methods that actually run the simulation. The file DiskRun.py contains some
good initial values to use and shows how to call the important functions to create a disk, run a simulation on it, and 
generate a plot.
